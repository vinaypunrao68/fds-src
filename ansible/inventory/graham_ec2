### This inventory file works for an as-yet-undefined host group named ec2hosts.
##   The group name is pre-defined here with no hosts specified. Running the
##   'deploy_fds_ec2.yml' playbook and passing in the name of this file as the
##   value for fds_cluster_name will cause a dynamic host group to be created
##   containing your new EC2 instance private IPs. This allows us to still use our
##   FDS-specific variables that you can customize as you need, without having
##   to hard-code any of them into the playbook.

### The 'awo-bh-01' is necessary for now, as Ansible's wait_for and
##   delegate_to modules don't play nice together at this time.

### A 'localhost' entry is mandatory! Ansible's EC2 module needs to be run
##   against localhost, since it's just interacting with the EC2 APIs.

### Uncomment this line if you want to customize your EC2 instances. Otherwise
##   just stick with the lone 'localhost' entry below
#localhost ec2_root_volume_size_GB=100 ec2_instance_type="t2.medium" ec2_vpc_subnet_id="subnet-195bac40" ec2_image="ami-0f114a3f"
